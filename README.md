### Abstract
Designing energy-efficient optimal controllers for vehicle control is an essential step towards achieving a ubiquitous, environmentally-friendly autonomous transportation model. This study explores the design and implementation of optimal control strategies that minimize the energy used by an electric car traversing a pre-established roadway. The explored control strategies dictate the vehicle’s output driving force as a function of its position on the chosen roadway through the minimization of a highly non-linear cost function that is representative of total energy use. The cost function is formulated subject to speed constraints (due to road speed limits), power limitations (due to physical limitations in the motor) and non-linear system dynamics that describe the vehicle’s speed as a function of driving force and road position. The study investigates the efficacy of several control strategies based on Dynamic Programming (DP) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) approaches and compares the respective results. This study finally analyzes the feasibility and pragmatism of implementing the above control approaches in various real-world scenarios.

### Using This Repository
The files used for this project are uploaded in the project file. All files are explicitlyused for the student's final project and strictly belong to them. Feel free to use the files as needed, and contact us for any issues. The class we took helped us understand the innerworkings of MPC and DP. Since this was an introductory class, some of the assumptions and methods used could use better modeling. Enjoy! :)
